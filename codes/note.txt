when you are too busy during whole the day
and you have done what you should do
and you are not involved in which you should not
you will feel and enjoy that moment
maybe the moment was painful for you
but you will not feel that pain
it will gives you real pleaser
you will notice that you are productive and avtive
you haven't wasted your time
and didn't make any nonesense
it's not mandetory that every single day will be the same as you plan
but when it's happens to you
that's the best moment
its my point of viwe, no matter what's your point of view
I enjoy,when I am busy to do something
and the most booring time is doing nothing!


if you try to do what you should 
but you don't get the output
